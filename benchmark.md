# LaraSVG Benchmark Results

> SVG → PNG conversion, 200×200 px output.  
> Each driver is run for up to 10,000 conversions or 60s, whichever comes first.  
> Peak RSS is the maximum resident set size of the converter binary for one conversion.

**Date:** 2026-02-15 22:43:08  
**Platform:** Darwin (arm64) PHP 8.4.17

## Notes

- Benchmark measures **wall-clock time** per conversion including process spawn overhead.
- **Peak RSS** is sampled via `/usr/bin/time` for a single representative conversion and reflects the converter binary's own memory, not PHP.
- First-run warmup is excluded from all measurements.
- Results vary by machine load, SVG complexity, and binary version.
- Inkscape and CairoSVG include interpreter/JVM startup cost per invocation.
- For production use, consider daemon modes (Inkscape shell mode, CairoSVG server) to amortize startup costs.
